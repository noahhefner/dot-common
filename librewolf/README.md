# Librewolf Notes

When running Sway, install Librewolf via the apt repository per the Librewolf installation instructions on the website. When running the Flatpak version with Sway, I couldn't get the download popup/dialog to work when attempting to download a file. Same with the Firefox Flatpak. So essentially I just couldnt download anything. The apt version does not have this issue, so I'm assuming it's something to do with Flatpak permissions.
